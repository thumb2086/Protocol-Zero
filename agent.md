Chinese Answer:

First, read the unfinished work in log.md and todo.md.

Make a plan and write todo.md.

Start revising.

Check for errors in the changes (sync project with Gradle flies, build app, project call errors).

If there are errors, revise them again.

If there are unfinished files or needed feature optimizations, write them in todo.md and revise them in the next conversation.

Write what was changed in log.md.

Remove the completed work from todo.md.

Then update README.md and readme_cn.md.

Minimize unnecessary words, be as concise and quick as possible, and perfectly fulfill the requirements.
